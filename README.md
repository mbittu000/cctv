# Webcam Recording & Management System

## üéØ What This Project Solves

Ever needed to monitor your space but found existing solutions too complicated, expensive, or lacking the features you want? This project solves that problem by providing a simple, self-hosted webcam recording system that you can set up anywhere.

## üö® The Problem

- **Commercial security cameras** are expensive and often require monthly subscriptions
- **Existing software** is either too complex to set up or lacks mobile access
- **Cloud services** store your private recordings on someone else's servers
- **Most solutions** don't let you easily browse and manage recordings from your phone
- **You want control** over your own data and recording schedule

## ‚úÖ How This Solves It

This system gives you:

### **Complete Control**

- Your recordings stay on **your own computer**
- No monthly fees or subscription costs
- Record as much or as little as you want
- Delete old recordings when you choose

### **Simple Setup**

- One command starts the recording server
- Works with any webcam or camera
- Automatically organizes recordings by date and time
- No complicated configuration needed

### **Mobile Access**

- View recordings from anywhere on your phone
- Download important videos to your device
- Browse recordings by date with a calendar
- Watch live feed or recorded videos

### **Privacy First**

- Everything runs on your local network
- Your recordings never leave your control
- No third-party services involved
- Open source - you can see exactly what it does

## üé¨ What It Does

### Recording Server

Continuously records from your webcam in 60-second clips, organizing them by date so you can easily find what you're looking for.

### Mobile App

Browse, watch, and download your recordings from your phone, tablet, or any device with a web browser.

## üè† Perfect For

- **Home monitoring** while you're away
- **Office security** for small businesses
- **Pet watching** to see what they do when you're gone
- **Time-lapse projects** with automatic recording
- **Evidence collection** for insurance or security purposes
- **Baby monitoring** with playback capabilities

## üîß What You Need

### Option 1: Computer Setup

- A computer with a webcam (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- A smartphone or tablet for viewing
- Both devices on the same WiFi network

### Option 2: Old Phone as Server (Budget-Friendly!)

- An old Android phone you're not using
- Termux app (free terminal emulator)
- The recording server can run entirely on your spare phone using:
  - **Termux** for the Linux environment
  - **FFmpeg** for video recording
  - **Go** compiler for running the server
- Another phone/tablet for viewing recordings

**Why use an old phone?** Turn that old device collecting dust into a dedicated security camera server that's always on, uses minimal power, and can be placed anywhere with WiFi!

## üöÄ Why I Built This

I needed a simple way to monitor my space without:

- Paying monthly fees to cloud services
- Dealing with complicated security camera setups
- Worrying about privacy and data ownership
- Being locked into proprietary systems

This solution puts you in complete control while being simple enough for anyone to use.

- **Video Browsing**: Browse recordings by date with calendar interface
- **Video Playback**: Built-in video player with full controls
- **Download Management**: Save videos to device storage
- **Live Streaming**: Real-time viewing of latest recordings
- **Server Configuration**: Configurable server connection settings
- **Storage Management**: View server statistics and delete old recordings

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Server**: Go 1.24.0+, FFmpeg, Webcam device
- **Client**: Node.js 16+, Expo CLI

### 1. Server Setup

```bash
cd server
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8080` with:

- Automatic webcam recording
- REST API endpoints
- Static file serving

### 2. Client Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Configure server connection in the app:

- Open app settings
- Enter server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`)
- Start browsing videos

## üì° API Overview

The server provides these main endpoints:

| Method   | Endpoint       | Description                       |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/getDates`    | Get all available recording dates |
| `GET`    | `/getVideos`   | Get videos for a specific date    |
| `GET`    | `/getDirStats` | Get server storage statistics     |
| `DELETE` | `/deleteDate`  | Delete all videos for a date      |
| `GET`    | `/static/*`    | Direct access to video files      |

## üé¨ How It Works

### Recording Process

1. **Server starts** and initializes webcam recording
2. **60-second clips** are continuously created using FFmpeg
3. **Videos are organized** by date (YYYY-MM-DD) and time (HH-MM-SS)
4. **Files are stored** in the public directory for HTTP access

### Client Interaction

1. **App connects** to the configured server
2. **Fetches available dates** and video lists
3. **Streams videos** directly from server
4. **Downloads videos** to device storage when requested
5. **Manages server storage** through delete operations

Example file structure:

```
server/public/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-08-09/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 15-22-36.mp4
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 15-23-08.mp4
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 15-23-39.mp4
```

## üîß Configuration

### Server Configuration

- **Recording duration**: Modify in `server/rec/rec.go`
- **Storage path**: Configure in `server/env/env.go`
- **API port**: Change in `server/uploader/uploader.go`

### Client Configuration

- **Server URL**: Set in app settings or `.env` file
- **App behavior**: Modify in `client/app.json`
- **UI customization**: Update components in `client/src/`

## üì± Supported Platforms

### Server

- **Windows** ‚úÖ
- **macOS** ‚úÖ
- **Linux** ‚úÖ

### Client

- **iOS** ‚úÖ
- **Android** ‚úÖ
- **Web** ‚úÖ (via Expo Web)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Server Development

```bash
cd server
go run main.go                    # Development
go build -o webcam-server main.go # Production build
```

### Client Development

```bash
cd client
npm start                # Development server
npm run ios             # iOS simulator
npm run android         # Android emulator
expo build:android      # Production APK
expo build:ios          # Production IPA
```

### Adding Features

**Server Side:**

- Add API routes in `server/uploader/router/route.go`
- Modify recording logic in `server/rec/rec.go`
- Update configuration in `server/env/env.go`

**Client Side:**

- Create components in `client/src/components/`
- Add screens in `client/src/pages/`
- Update navigation in `client/App.js`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Server Issues

- **Recording fails**: Check FFmpeg installation and camera permissions
- **API errors**: Verify port availability and firewall settings
- **Storage issues**: Check disk space and directory permissions

### Client Issues

- **Connection failed**: Verify server URL and network connectivity
- **Video playback**: Check video format and network bandwidth
- **Download failures**: Verify storage permissions and available space

### Network Setup

- Ensure both server and client are on the same network
- Configure firewall to allow traffic on server port (default: 8080)
- For remote access, consider port forwarding or VPN setup

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Server

- **Storage**: ~10-50MB per minute of recording
- **CPU**: Moderate usage during FFmpeg encoding
- **Memory**: Minimal footprint for concurrent operations
- **Network**: Direct file serving, bandwidth scales with concurrent users

### Client

- **Storage**: Downloaded videos consume device storage
- **Network**: Streaming requires stable connection
- **Battery**: Video playback and downloading impact battery life
- **Memory**: Proper video player disposal prevents memory leaks

## üîí Security & Production

### Security Notes

- **Local Network**: Designed for trusted local network use
- **No Authentication**: Default setup has no user authentication
- **File Access**: Direct file access through static serving
- **HTTPS**: Consider HTTPS for production deployments

### Production Deployment

- **Server**: Build binary and run as system service
- **Client**: Build APK/IPA for app store distribution
- **Security**: Implement authentication and HTTPS
- **Monitoring**: Add logging and health check endpoints
